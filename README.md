# Overview

This WebSharper Extension provides bindings to the [Google Maps utility
library](https://code.google.com/p/google-maps-utility-library-v3/)'s
MarkerClusterer, version 3.0. When used in WebSharper projects, these
stub classes delegate the work to the actual classes implemented in
the library.

After adding the reference to the project all the classes can be found
under the `IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Maps.MarkerClusterer`
module.
